A modern React (Vite) frontend for the intelligent calculator application.
It features a sleek dark UI with neon blue highlights, interactive buttons, and smooth animations. Users can:
🔢 Evaluate complex mathematical expressions using the backend APIs
📈 Parse and visualize polynomials with live graph rendering
🎛️ Switch between RAD/DEG modes for trigonometric operations
Built with React + JavaScript, the frontend connects seamlessly to the Calculator Backend (that can be found here: https://github.com/mihabradea/Calculator_Backend) to deliver a complete full-stack calculator experience.
